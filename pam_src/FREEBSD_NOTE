	         <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>
	         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
	         <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>
	         <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
	         <http://www.perl.org/>
	Makefile:380: recipe for target 'aclocal.m4' failed
	make: *** [aclocal.m4] Error 127
